# Git Tutorial

## Importing a new Project
Assume you have my-project directory in your machine and it contains some source code files. You can place it under Git revision control as follows.
```shell
cd my-project
git init
```
Git will reply
```
Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
```
You’ve now initialized the working directory—​you may notice a new directory created, named ".git".
