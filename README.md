# Programming Tutoring


This document is a short guide and summary of the Induction Talk so you can revisit it over the course of the year.

## Online Resources
If you are looking for resources to learn programming, the following could be a good starter point:
- [Learn You A Haskell For Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) is a great online book to quickly get a grasp of Haskell, and is officially recommended by UCL.
- [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) is a very good source for online courses that can be followed at students' own paces. All UCL students have free access to LinkedIn Learning via their UCL email address
- YouTube also has some good videos when looking for specific topics. Example channels that could be useful:
- [TheNewBoston](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston/playlists) Beginner-friendly programming tutorials in C, Python, and Java
- [Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRhX6r2uhhlubuF5QextdCSM) Intermediate-advanced programming / data structure tutorials

## Extra Technologies
Besides the four programming languages - **Python**, **C**, **Haskell**, **Java**, I will also cover some of the following useful technologies in future programming tutoring sessions 
- Git and GitHub
    - [Git](http://git-scm.com) is a version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and effiency. 
    - [GitHub](http://github.com) is an Internet hosting service for software development and version cocntrol using **git**.
- MarkDown
    - [Markdown]() is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. 
    - You may create a markdown file (*README.md*) to describe your project.
- LaTeX
    - [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a high-quality typesetting system that helps with the production of technical and scientific documentation, such as *report*, *essay*, and *resume*.
- HTML and CSS
    - [HTML]() is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
    - [CSS]() is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in **HTML**
    - These two plus **JavaScript** are the main languages for front-end development
