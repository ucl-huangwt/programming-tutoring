# Programming Tutoring


This document is a short guide and summary of the Induction Talk so you can revisit it over the course of the year.

## Online Resources
- [Learn You A Haskell For Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) is a great online book to quickly get a grasp of Haskell, and is officially recommended by UCL.
- [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) is a very good source for online courses that can be followed at students' own paces. All UCL students have free access to LinkedIn Learning via their UCL email address
- YouTube also has some good videos when looking for specific topics. Example channels that could be useful:
- [TheNewBoston](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston/playlists) Beginner-friendly programming tutorials in C, Python, and Java
- [Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRhX6r2uhhlubuF5QextdCSM) Intermediate-advanced programming / data structure tutorials
